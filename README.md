# Hospital Data Modeling and Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Hospital Data Modeling and Analysis** project is an end-to-end solution aimed at tackling the challenges of decentralized and inefficient data management in a sprawling hospital system. This project focuses on building a centralized database and data warehouse system that ensures secure, scalable, and performant handling of patient records, diseases, medications, treatment plans, and operational data. 

The solution includes:
- **Relational Data Model**
- **Dimensional Data Model**
- **NoSQL Database Design**
- **Advanced Analytics using Tableau**
- **Cloud Deployment using AWS**
- **Modern Data Warehousing with Snowflake**

## Features
- **Relational Database**: Efficiently stores patient, disease, medication, treatment, and appointment details with defined entity relationships.
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Star schema design for analytical processing.
- **NoSQL Design**: MongoDB schema for flexible and scalable storage.
- **Data Visualization**: Insights presented using Tableau dashboards.
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS deployment for resilience, performance, and security.
- **Data Warehousing**: Snowflake integration for advanced data operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (RDS, Aurora, S3, EC2, Route 53)
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau
- **Languages**: SQL, Python
- **ETL Tool**: Custom SQL-based ETL processes

## Key Components

### 1. **Relational Data Model**
   - Entities: Patients, Diseases, Doctors, Medications, Treatments, Appointments, Hospital Wards.
   - Relationships: Many-to-Many (e.g., Patients-Diseases), One-to-Many (e.g., Doctors-Treatments).

### 2. **Dimensional Model**
   - Schema: Star schema for efficient querying.
   - Use Case: Analytical queries like patient gender distribution, top 5 doctors by appointments, etc.

### 3. **NoSQL Model**
   - MongoDB Design: Encapsulates data into a single "Treatments" collection for faster data retrieval without joins.
   - Example Document: Includes patient, disease, doctor, and treatment details.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Tableau Dashboard**: Analysis includes Patient Demographics, Disease Trends, and Treatment Effectiveness.
   - Published Dashboard: [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/HospitalOperationsandPerformanceAnalysis/HospitalOperationsandPerformanceAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### 5. **Cloud Deployment**
   - AWS Architecture:
     - Multi-AZ Deployment for resilience.
     - Aurora DB for high performance.
     - AWS WAF for security against threats.
   - Components: RDS, S3, IAM Roles, Route 53, CloudWatch.

### 6. **Data Warehousing**
   - Snowflake Advantages:
     - Elastic scalability.
     - Zero-copy cloning.
     - Secure data sharing and time travel.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Setup PostgreSQL or MongoDB based on the relational or NoSQL model requirements.
3. Use the provided SQL scripts for database setup and sample data insertion.
4. Deploy the database on AWS or a local environment.
5. Visualize data using Tableau by connecting it to the PostgreSQL database.
